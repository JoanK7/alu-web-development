                <article> <h1>Learning HTML</h1>
                    <p>With our introduction to HTML and CSS complete, itâ€™s time to dig a little deeper into HTML and examine the different components that make up this language.</p>
                    <h2>Intro to HTML</h2>
                    <p>In order to start building websites, we need to learn a little about which HTML elements are best used to display different types of content. Itâ€™s also important to understand how elements are visually displayed on a web page, as well as what different elements mean semantically.</p>
                    <h3>So what are semantics?</h3>
                    <p>So what exactly are semantics? Semantics within HTML is the practice of giving content on the page meaning and structure by using the proper element. Semantic code describes the value of content on a page, regardless of the style or appearance of that content. There are several benefits to using semantic elements, including enabling computers, screen readers, search engines, and other devices to adequately read and understand the content on a web page. Additionally, semantic HTML is easier to manage and work with, as it shows clearly what each piece of content is about.</p>
                    <p>Moving forward, as new elements are introduced, weâ€™ll talk about what those elements actually mean and the type of content they best represent. Before we do that, though, letâ€™s look at two elementsâ€”div and span â€”that actually donâ€™t hold any semantic value. They exist for styling purposes only.</p></article>

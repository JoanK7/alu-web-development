                <h2>Intro to HTML</h2>
                <p>In order to start building websites, we need to learn a little about which HTML elements are best used to display different types of content. Itâ€™s also important to understand how elements are visually displayed on a web page, as well as what different elements mean semantically.</p>
                <h3>So what are semantics?</h3>
                <p>So what exactly are semantics? Semantics within HTML is the practice of giving content on the page meaning and structure by using the proper element. Semantic code describes the value of content on a page, regardless of the style or appearance of that content. There are several benefits to using semantic elements, including enabling computers, screen readers, search engines, and other devices to adequately read and understand the content on a web page. Additionally, semantic HTML is easier to manage and work with, as it shows clearly what each piece of content is about.</p>
